Halfway through the year already and we are about to roll out training on our laser cutter to the first group of 
members. It still needs some work to improve the accuracy, but it is great for small pieces.

We have started to run our Monday Mechatronics from 1730 to enable junior members to come along. Hopefully they will be
entering PI WARS 2024.

Thursday evenings are proving popular for 3D printing and our Stitch and Bitch evenings. More information can be found
on our facebook page.

Talking of 3D printing, some of our members have printed a quarter size R2D2, watch this page, and we will post a
picture when it is complete. Another member is making a full size K9 from Doctor Who.
