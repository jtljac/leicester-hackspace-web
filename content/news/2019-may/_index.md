# cspell:ignore Sierpinski

One of our busiest months with two exhibitions in Birmingham

3D Printer Meetup Birmingham

Last year Keith attended the first 3D Printer meetup in Birmingham. 
This year he went back with Hackspace members Bill and Jan with our own stand.

I think something went wrong with the timing of the last Sierpinski Pyramid. A case of Last Man Standing?

On Saturday, May 11th Tony represented Leicester Hackspace on the National Hackspace Stand at Makers Central NEC.

His milk bottle recycling and spark generator were well received.
