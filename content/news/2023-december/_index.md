We held a Sunday crafting event just before Christmas. The Laser Cutter was put to use making some baubles and lanterns out of plywood. Cardboard was not quite as successful, we need to work on the settings. The laser cutter still needs some fine tuning for large cuts, but for small pieces it is fantatsic. Keep your eye on Slack (for members) or Facebook for detailson training courses.
