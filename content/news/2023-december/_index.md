We held a Sunday crafting event just before Christmas. The Laser Cutter was put to use making some baubles and lanterns
out of plywood. Cardboard was not quite as successful, we need to work on the settings. The laser cutter still needs
some fine-tuning for large cuts, but for small pieces it is fantastic. Keep your eye on Slack (for members) or Facebook
for details on training courses.
