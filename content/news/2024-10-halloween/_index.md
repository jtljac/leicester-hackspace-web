I cannot believe it has been a year since our last post!

We went to create-a-con at the LCB depot in March, attended by several of our members and we had lots of visitors.

Throughout the year we have held Raspberry PI Jams which have been well attended, demonstrating the new PI5, the AI Hat and the Pico 2.

Our next one is November when hopefully we will have the new AI camera to demonstrate.

Halloween is nearly on us and we held a crafting session on Saturday October 26th.

The Laser Cutter and 3D printers were in use, along with other crafts.

Coming up in November is our Trebuchet event on November 16th and Christmas Crafts on the 30th.
