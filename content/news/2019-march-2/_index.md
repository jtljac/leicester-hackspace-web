We had 21 tickets taken up out of 40 for the event with 17 attendees plus members. 
There was a workshop area with 8 Pis where attendees could use Scratch or Python to control some traffic light LEDS provided by the foundation. 
Russ brought along his collections of Pis with a robot arm , Steve brought along some of his robots. 
In the Pi noon arena James Pi Wars entry had several hours of testing. 
Our doorman George did a great job welcoming people.
