One of our younger members James competed in PI-Wars 2019 at Cambridge at the weekend.
He was placed 10 out of 15 in his class which is a fantastic result as he never competed in any of the autonomous
challenges.
He managed to get through to the quarter-finals of PI-Noon where you have to burst balloons on your competitors robot.
