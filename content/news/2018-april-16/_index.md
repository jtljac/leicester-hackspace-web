The photograph below shows Bill's rapidly increasing collection of robots for his CodeClub.

The processors are Raspberry PI's, Micro-Bit's and Crumble's. Chassis's are made out of cardboard or 3D printed, with a 3D printed holder for the castor wheel.

All connected using crocodile clips.

I wonder what the next one will be?
