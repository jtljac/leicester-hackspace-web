We recently acquired some photon devices from [Particle.io](https://particle.io/). One of our members has installed a unit in the Hackspace 
connected to two PIRs and Temperature sensor. This device connects to the Hackspace Wi-Fi and enables the device to be 
re-programmed remotely and the data streamed to a site and graphed. During the lockdown this has enabled some degree of 
remote monitoring. If you are interested in this type of project, then come on down when we re-open to new members. 
Current data is shown below.
