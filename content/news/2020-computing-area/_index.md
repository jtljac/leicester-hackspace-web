Thanks to sterling work by several of our members, we now have a computing area comprising 6 dual booting PC's running
Windows 10 or Linux Mint.
Two of the PC's have dual monitors and all are connected to the internet.

All PC's have design software, 3D printing slicers, software development packages.

They were recently successfully used by our second code club session.
