One of our members, James, was due to compete for the second year in PI WARS. Hoping to improve on last year's 
performance. Unfortunately PI Wars was cancelled in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was replaced by a virtual PI 
Wars competition held on YouTube. Competitors had to submit a 5-minute video of their robot. Viewers then had a chance to 
vote and pick the best robot. All robots can be seen here
