Thursday April 5th saw the first of our Radio Control Jams, happening on the first and third Thursday of the month.

Star model of the evening was Dave's Radio Controlled Buggy.

> "I took a battered and unwanted 3 wheeled buggy and stripped it down of all unnessesary parts, designed and 3d printed adapters for the wheel hubs to take a standard toothed belt, added a second stage of gearing and used a couple of old quadcopter motors i had kicking around (with ESCs and reciever), the result is somewhat limited having very little torque at low speeds and has no reverse, but its great fun to drive!"
