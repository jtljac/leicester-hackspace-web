We are getting ready to re-open for face to face meetings. 
Members have been busy during lockdown repairing machines and getting rid of excess equipment. 
We should have two CNC machines, a Vinyl Cutter and our laser cutter ready for members to use. 
One of the jobs was to re-fit some of the roof insulation tiles.
