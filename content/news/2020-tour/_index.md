During the COVID-19 lockdown the Hackspace has been closed to new members and has only been open to existing members with a valid reason for access. 
One of our relatively new members, Max Ruffels, has created a virtual tour which is on our YouTube channel and has a link from our members page. 
If you want to see our resources, check it out and come down for a tour when we re-open.
