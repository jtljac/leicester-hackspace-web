We have finished the year off with a trebuchet event, Christmas Crafts and the last PI Jam of the year.

Unfortunately due to ill health we only had two entries for the trebuchet contest.

The Christmas Craft event was well attended with the Laser Cutter out to good use.

Some visitors are already asking about next years event.

The last PI Jam was held on a Monday evening with the bew AI Camera on display.

We now have quite a collection of PI5's and PICO's for members to use.

Look out for more events in 2025.
