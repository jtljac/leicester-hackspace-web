The Hackspace attended creat-a-con at the LBC on Saturday, 9th March. It was another great success. Once the doors
opened we had a steady flow of visitors. So many in fact we did not have time to take any pictures, we are waiting for
the official ones. The 3D printers and sandbox were a great success, with lots of visitors asking about the PI's and
high energy display.
