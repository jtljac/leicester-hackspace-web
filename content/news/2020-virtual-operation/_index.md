We have left all of our regular events on the diary. 
At the moment we are holding zoom sessions on a Monday Evening for Mechatronics and Wednesday evening for a regular Blender tutorial. 
If you are interested, please check out our Facebook page for details on how to join. 
Monday evenings are great if you have a problem with a Raspberry PI, Microbit, Arduino, Crumble or anything electronic.
