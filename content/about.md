The Hackspace is essentially a shared workshop run by the members for the members.

Imagine you had five friends with sets of tools, you all decided to get together and rent a double garage where you
would each work on your own projects in a shared space. You share the cost of rent and utilities. It’s not a service so
none of you are obliged to use the space or to help each other, but it’s there when you want to use it. As you are
friends you might also choose to help each other every now and again or to teach each other how to do something.

The Hackspace is just like that but instead of five members as of 2024 we currently have over 150 members.

## What's the space like?  {.header}

During Lockdown one of our members has created a short video tour of the Hackspace which can be viewed on our YouTube
channel. It's a little out of date, but it still pretty well shows off what we're about.

## How can the space used? {.header}

Provided members keep paying their monthly dues, the hackspace is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Initially new members
are advised to come in the evenings when others are there until they really know their way around the space, how to
safely open up and lock up the space after having cleaned up after themselves.

All the tools and equipment are available to every member. But members use the equipment strictly at their own risk and
are self certifying as to their ability to use it safely. If help is required a member who has experience in using a 
piece of equipment who will show you how, but that person is NOT a formal technician or a teacher.

Members generally work on their own projects, but it's a great place to socialise, meet like-minded people to acquire
skills from, or pass skills on to.

## Our History {.header}

Since its opening in 2014, Leicester Hackspace has had 3 locations. Each move has given us more space to accommodate an
increase in Membership and space for more equipment.

In December 2017 we moved to premises on the Faircharm Trading Estate. This gave us space for heavy duty woodworking
equipment and the prospects of a Laser Cutter.

Previously we had been at the De Montfort University Innovation Centre.
