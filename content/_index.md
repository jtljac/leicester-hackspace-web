Leicester Hackspace is a venue for makers of digital, electronic, mechanical and creative projects


{{< img src="img/3dprinters.jpg" title="3D Printers" >}}

Like other Hackspaces across the country, we are working to build a community of practical and creative people and provide them with a place to pursue their projects, share techniques and concepts and learn new skills.

Members have access to bike repair equipment, computers, a 3D printer, 3D miller/scanner, power tools and many other resources 24 hours a day. We also run special courses and events, in programming, arduino, electronics, soldering, and more, which are open to members of the public.
