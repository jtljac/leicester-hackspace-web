## What are the benefits of membership? {.header}
As a member you get free access to the space to work on your projects whenever you want; you get free access to social
events in the space; you can be elected to the management committee; you can vote on fundraising priorities; you get
free use of WiFi; and, most importantly, you will be actively helping to make Leicester Hackspace a success.

## OK, I’m in! {.header}
Great! But hold on just a moment there before you fully commit.  
Prospective members should first come along to one of our [open days on Tuesday evenings](/diary). You can just turn up 
between 7 and 9pm, please let us know if you plan to visit by email [membership@leicesterhackspace.org.uk](mailto:membership@leicesterhackspace.org.uk)
so we can make sure someone's prepared to show you around.

You'll get the opportunity to have a look at the space, see what equipment we have available, chat with current members 
and confirm that you want to join. 

Once you've decided your happy, we'll hand over a membership form for you to complete, and once you've sorted your 
membership fees you'll officially become a member.

## Membership fees? {.header}
Leicester Hackspace is funded entirely by its members. Every month we need to pay our rent, insurance, internet and
electricity bills, plus we try to raise money for new equipment. Our main source of income is membership fees.

We expect for most members to pay a £10 monthly membership fee. But we don’t believe in a fixed monthly membership fee. 
Please donate what you feel is appropriate. This should in part reflect how much you plan to use the space and in part
how much you can afford. Even if you don’t plan to use the space a great deal then we will still value you as a member 
and will welcome your financial contribution.

When setting up your fee payments, you should either set up a standing order (details on the form) or make a monthly 
PayPal donation using the button below. 
**A Standing order is our preferred method of payment because it does not incur fees.** But if you do use prefer to use 
PayPal then we request an additional 60p for every £10 you donate to cover the extra processing fees. 
Remember to make your PayPal donation a recurring, monthly, payment.

## Lapsed Membership {.header}
Once you stop making your monthly donation your membership will be marked as lapsed, and you will be asked to return 
your key fob and remove your storage box. If you are unable to make a monthly donation but still wish to remain a 
member, please talk to us and we will be happy to work something out that works for you.
